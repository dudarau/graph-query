# graph-query

The main idea of the repository is to make an overview of different approaches of React-query library for Mature FE applications.
To consider pros/cons of different architectures of FE applications based on the library.

It's really difficult to assess any library with small examples. 
To understand all benefits we should consider its scalability and maintainability for Mature FE applications.

By Mature FE applications I mean applications with next characteristics:
[] over 100 components
[] 4 and more developers
[] nothing is written in stone - means configuration/API-contracts/design and so on can be changed
